-- Short Exercise: Warming Up

{-
Weâ€™ll be doing something here very similar to what you saw above, to give you
practice and try to develop a feel or intuition for what is to come. These are
similar enough to what you just saw that you can almost copy and paste, so try
not to overthink them too much.
