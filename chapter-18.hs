Write bind in terms of fmap and join. Fear is the mind-killer, friend. You can
do it.

showed you to validate your instances.

This one should be easier than the Applicative instance was. Remember to use the
Functor that Monad requires, then see where the chips fall.

Write the following functions using the methods provided by Monad and
Functor. Using stuff like identity and composition is fine, but it has to
typecheck with types provided.
